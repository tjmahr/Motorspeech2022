### Abstract

Speech perception is a probabilistic process, integrating bottom-up and
top-down sources of information, and the frequency or structure of a
word can predict how well it is perceived. Therefore, instead of asking
how intelligible speakers are, it is also important to ask how
intelligible individual words are. For this study, we measured the
intelligibility of 165 children between 30 and 47 months in age on 38
different words and asked how words varied in intelligibility and
whether word-level characteristics (frequency, phonotactic probability,
motor complexity) predicted intelligibility. An item-response analysis
showed that there was considerable variation in individual words with a
reliable effect of frequency such that higher frequency words were more
intelligible.
